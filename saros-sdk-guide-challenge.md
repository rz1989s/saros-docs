## Overview

Help create developer documentation that makes Saros SDKs a joy to build with. Ship guides that cut friction and fast-track hackathon builders from zero to shipping.

- **Documentation format** in Markdown, Notion, or a hosted doc site with public access

### Optional (Bonus Points)

- Troubleshooting guide or FAQ
- Comparison guide to help other developers pick the optimal SDK for their project
- Visual aids such as diagrams, screenshots, or GIF walkthroughs
- Developer-friendly navigation with search or ability to configure and test it live

## Quality Standards
